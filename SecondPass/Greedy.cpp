    455. Assign Cookies
    https://leetcode.com/problems/assign-cookies/
    Assume you are an awesome parent and want to give your children some cookies. But, you should give each child at most 
    one cookie.

    Each child i has a greed factor g[i], which is the minimum size of a cookie that the child will be content with; and 
    each cookie j has a size s[j]. If s[j] >= g[i], we can assign the cookie j to the child i, and the child i will be 
    content. Your goal is to maximize the number of your content children and output the maximum number.

    
    Example 1:
    Input: g = [1,2,3], s = [1,1]
    Output: 1
    Explanation: You have 3 children and 2 cookies. The greed factors of 3 children are 1, 2, 3. 
    And even though you have 2 cookies, since their size is both 1, you could only make the child whose greed factor is 1 content.
    You need to output 1.

    Example 2:
    Input: g = [1,2], s = [1,2,3]
    Output: 2
    Explanation: You have 2 children and 3 cookies. The greed factors of 2 children are 1, 2. 
    You have 3 cookies and their sizes are big enough to gratify all of the children, 
    You need to output 2.
    

    Constraints:
    1 <= g.length <= 3 * 10^4
    0 <= s.length <= 3 * 10^4
    1 <= g[i], s[j] <= 2^31 - 1

    376. Wiggle Subsequence
    https://leetcode.com/problems/wiggle-subsequence/
    A wiggle sequence is a sequence where the differences between successive numbers strictly alternate between positive 
    and negative. The first difference (if one exists) may be either positive or negative. A sequence with one element 
    and a sequence with two non-equal elements are trivially wiggle sequences.

    For example, [1, 7, 4, 9, 2, 5] is a wiggle sequence because the differences (6, -3, 5, -7, 3) alternate between positive 
    and negative. In contrast, [1, 4, 7, 2, 5] and [1, 7, 4, 5, 5] are not wiggle sequences. The first is not because its 
    first two differences are positive, and the second is not because its last difference is zero.
    A subsequence is obtained by deleting some elements (possibly zero) from the original sequence, leaving the remaining 
    elements in their original order.

    Given an integer array nums, return the length of the longest wiggle subsequence of nums.

    
    Example 1:
    Input: nums = [1,7,4,9,2,5]
    Output: 6
    Explanation: The entire sequence is a wiggle sequence with differences (6, -3, 5, -7, 3).

    Example 2:
    Input: nums = [1,17,5,10,13,15,10,5,16,8]
    Output: 7
    Explanation: There are several subsequences that achieve this length.
    One is [1, 17, 10, 13, 10, 16, 8] with differences (16, -7, 3, -3, 6, -8).

    Example 3:
    Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]
    Output: 2
    

    Constraints:
    1 <= nums.length <= 1000

    134. Gas Station
    https://leetcode.com/problems/gas-station/
    There are n gas stations along a circular route, where the amount of gas at the ith station is gas[i].

    You have a car with an unlimited gas tank and it costs cost[i] of gas to travel from the ith station to its next (i + 1)th 
    station. You begin the journey with an empty tank at one of the gas stations.

    Given two integer arrays gas and cost, return the starting gas station's index if you can travel around the circuit once in 
    the clockwise direction, otherwise return -1. If there exists a solution, it is guaranteed to be unique


    Example 1:
    Input: gas = [1,2,3,4,5], cost = [3,4,5,1,2]
    Output: 3
    Explanation:
    Start at station 3 (index 3) and fill up with 4 unit of gas. Your tank = 0 + 4 = 4
    Travel to station 4. Your tank = 4 - 1 + 5 = 8
    Travel to station 0. Your tank = 8 - 2 + 1 = 7
    Travel to station 1. Your tank = 7 - 3 + 2 = 6
    Travel to station 2. Your tank = 6 - 4 + 3 = 5
    Travel to station 3. The cost is 5. Your gas is just enough to travel back to station 3.
    Therefore, return 3 as the starting index.

    Example 2:
    Input: gas = [2,3,4], cost = [3,4,3]
    Output: -1
    Explanation:
    You can't start at station 0 or 1, as there is not enough gas to travel to the next station.
    Let's start at station 2 and fill up with 4 unit of gas. Your tank = 0 + 4 = 4
    Travel to station 0. Your tank = 4 - 3 + 2 = 3
    Travel to station 1. Your tank = 3 - 3 + 3 = 3
    You cannot travel back to station 2, as it requires 4 unit of gas but you only have 3.
    Therefore, you can't travel around the circuit once no matter where you start.

    one lemonade and pay with either a $5, $10, or $20 bill. You must provide the correct change 
    to each customer so that the net transaction is that the customer pays $5.

    Note that you do not have any change in hand at first.

    From the fourth customer, we collect a $10 bill and give back a $5.

    452. Minimum Number of Arrows to Burst Balloons
    https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-number-of-arrows-to-burst-balloons/
    There are some spherical balloons taped onto a flat wall that represents the XY-plane. 
    The balloons are represented as a 2D integer array points where points[i] = [xstart, xend] 
    denotes a balloon whose horizontal diameter stretches between xstart and xend. You do not 
    know the exact y-coordinates of the balloons.

    Arrows can be shot up directly vertically (in the positive y-direction) from different points 
    along the x-axis. A balloon with xstart and xend is burst by an arrow shot at x if 
    xstart <= x <= xend. There is no limit to the number of arrows that can be shot. A shot arrow 
    keeps traveling up infinitely, bursting any balloons in its path.

    Given the array points, return the minimum number of arrows that must be shot to burst all 
    balloons.


    Example 1:
    Input: points = [[10,16],[2,8],[1,6],[7,12]]
    Output: 2
    Explanation: The balloons can be burst by 2 arrows:
    - Shoot an arrow at x = 6, bursting the balloons [2,8] and [1,6].
    - Shoot an arrow at x = 11, bursting the balloons [10,16] and [7,12].

    Example 2:
    Input: points = [[1,2],[3,4],[5,6],[7,8]]
    Output: 4
    Explanation: One arrow needs to be shot for each balloon for a total of 4 arrows.

    Example 3:
    Input: points = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[4,5]]
    Output: 2
    Explanation: The balloons can be burst by 2 arrows:
    - Shoot an arrow at x = 2, bursting the balloons [1,2] and [2,3].
    - Shoot an arrow at x = 4, bursting the balloons [3,4] and [4,5].

    435. Non-overlapping Intervals
    https://leetcode.com/problems/non-overlapping-intervals/
    Given an array of intervals intervals where intervals[i] = [starti, endi], return the 
    minimum number of intervals you need to remove to make the rest of the intervals 
    non-overlapping.


    Example 1:
    Input: intervals = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[1,3]]
    Output: 1
    Explanation: [1,3] can be removed and the rest of the intervals are non-overlapping.

    Example 2:
    Input: intervals = [[1,2],[1,2],[1,2]]
    Output: 2
    Explanation: You need to remove two [1,2] to make the rest of the intervals non-overlapping.

    Example 3:
    Input: intervals = [[1,2],[2,3]]
    Output: 0
    Explanation: You don't need to remove any of the intervals since they're already non-overlapping.
    

    Constraints:
    1 <= intervals.length <= 10^5
    intervals[i].length == 2
    -5 * 10^4 <= starti < endi <= 5 * 10^4
