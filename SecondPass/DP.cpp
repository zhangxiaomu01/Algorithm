    509. Fibonacci Number
    https://leetcode.com/problems/fibonacci-number/
    The Fibonacci numbers, commonly denoted F(n) form a sequence, called the Fibonacci 
    sequence, such that each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1. 
    That is,

    F(0) = 0, F(1) = 1
    F(n) = F(n - 1) + F(n - 2), for n > 1.
    Given n, calculate F(n).

    

    Example 1:
    Input: n = 2
    Output: 1
    Explanation: F(2) = F(1) + F(0) = 1 + 0 = 1.

    Example 2:
    Input: n = 3
    Output: 2
    Explanation: F(3) = F(2) + F(1) = 1 + 1 = 2.

    Example 3:
    Input: n = 4
    Output: 3
    Explanation: F(4) = F(3) + F(2) = 2 + 1 = 3.

    You are given an array of integers stones where stones[i] is the weight of the ith stone.

    We are playing a game with the stones. On each turn, we choose any two stones and smash them 
    together. Suppose the stones have weights x and y with x <= y. The result of this smash is:

    If x == y, both stones are destroyed, and
    If x != y, the stone of weight x is destroyed, and the stone of weight y has new weight y - x.
    At the end of the game, there is at most one stone left.

    Return the smallest possible weight of the left stone. If there are no stones left, return 0.

    

    Example 1:
    Input: stones = [2,7,4,1,8,1]
    Output: 1
    Explanation:
    We can combine 2 and 4 to get 2, so the array converts to [2,7,1,8,1] then,

 /*
    494. Target Sum
    https://leetcode.com/problems/target-sum/
    You are given an integer array nums and an integer target.

    You want to build an expression out of nums by adding one of the symbols '+' and '-' before 
    each integer in nums and then concatenate all the integers.

    For example, if nums = [2, 1], you can add a '+' before 2 and a '-' before 1 and concatenate 
    them to build the expression "+2-1".
    Return the number of different expressions that you can build, which evaluates to target.

    

    Example 1:
    Input: nums = [1,1,1,1,1], target = 3
    Output: 5
    Explanation: There are 5 ways to assign symbols to make the sum of nums be target 3.
    -1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 3
    +1 - 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 3
    +1 + 1 - 1 + 1 + 1 = 3
    +1 + 1 + 1 - 1 + 1 = 3
    +1 + 1 + 1 + 1 - 1 = 3

    Example 2:
    Input: nums = [1], target = 1
    Output: 1
    

    Constraints:
    1 <= nums.length <= 20
    0 <= nums[i] <= 1000

    You are given an array of binary strings strs and two integers m and n.

    the subset.

    A set x is a subset of a set y if all elements of x are also elements of y.

    

    Example 1:
    Input: strs = ["10","0001","111001","1","0"], m = 5, n = 3
    Output: 4
    Explanation: The largest subset with at most 5 0's and 3 1's is {"10", "0001", "1", "0"}, so the answer is 4.
    Other valid but smaller subsets include {"0001", "1"} and {"10", "1", "0"}.
    {"111001"} is an invalid subset because it contains 4 1's, greater than the maximum of 3.

    Example 2:
    Input: strs = ["10","0","1"], m = 1, n = 1
    Output: 2
    Explanation: The largest subset is {"0", "1"}, so the answer is 2.

    139. Word Break
    https://leetcode.com/problems/word-break/
    Given a string s and a dictionary of strings wordDict, return true if s can be segmented into 
    a space-separated sequence of one or more dictionary words.

    Note that the same word in the dictionary may be reused multiple times in the segmentation.

    

    Example 1:
    Input: s = "leetcode", wordDict = ["leet","code"]
    Output: true
    Explanation: Return true because "leetcode" can be segmented as "leet code".

    Example 2:
    Input: s = "applepenapple", wordDict = ["apple","pen"]
    Output: true
    Explanation: Return true because "applepenapple" can be segmented as "apple pen apple".
    Note that you are allowed to reuse a dictionary word.

    Example 3:
    Input: s = "catsandog", wordDict = ["cats","dog","sand","and","cat"]
    Output: false
    

    Constraints:
    1 <= s.length <= 300
    1 <= wordDict.length <= 1000

    188. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock IV
    https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock-iv/
    You are given an integer array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the 
    ith day, and an integer k.

    Find the maximum profit you can achieve. You may complete at most k transactions: i.e. you 
    may buy at most k times and sell at most k times.

    Note: You may not engage in multiple transactions simultaneously (i.e., you must sell the 
    stock before you buy again).

    

    Example 1:
    Input: k = 2, prices = [2,4,1]
    Output: 2
    Explanation: Buy on day 1 (price = 2) and sell on day 2 (price = 4), profit = 4-2 = 2.

    Example 2:
    Input: k = 2, prices = [3,2,6,5,0,3]
    Output: 7
    Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 2) and sell on day 3 (price = 6), profit = 6-2 = 4. Then buy on day 5 (price = 0) and sell on day 6 (price = 3), profit = 3-0 = 3.
    

    Constraints:
    1 <= k <= 100
    1 <= prices.length <= 1000
    0 <= prices[i] <= 1000
