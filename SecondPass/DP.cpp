    509. Fibonacci Number
    https://leetcode.com/problems/fibonacci-number/
    The Fibonacci numbers, commonly denoted F(n) form a sequence, called the Fibonacci 
    sequence, such that each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1. 
    That is,

    F(0) = 0, F(1) = 1
    F(n) = F(n - 1) + F(n - 2), for n > 1.
    Given n, calculate F(n).

    

    Example 1:
    Input: n = 2
    Output: 1
    Explanation: F(2) = F(1) + F(0) = 1 + 0 = 1.

    Example 2:
    Input: n = 3
    Output: 2
    Explanation: F(3) = F(2) + F(1) = 1 + 1 = 2.

    Example 3:
    Input: n = 4
    Output: 3
    Explanation: F(4) = F(3) + F(2) = 2 + 1 = 3.

    You are given an array of integers stones where stones[i] is the weight of the ith stone.

    We are playing a game with the stones. On each turn, we choose any two stones and smash them 
    together. Suppose the stones have weights x and y with x <= y. The result of this smash is:

    If x == y, both stones are destroyed, and
    If x != y, the stone of weight x is destroyed, and the stone of weight y has new weight y - x.
    At the end of the game, there is at most one stone left.

    Return the smallest possible weight of the left stone. If there are no stones left, return 0.

    

    Example 1:
    Input: stones = [2,7,4,1,8,1]
    Output: 1
    Explanation:
    We can combine 2 and 4 to get 2, so the array converts to [2,7,1,8,1] then,

 /*
    494. Target Sum
    https://leetcode.com/problems/target-sum/
    You are given an integer array nums and an integer target.

    You want to build an expression out of nums by adding one of the symbols '+' and '-' before 
    each integer in nums and then concatenate all the integers.

    For example, if nums = [2, 1], you can add a '+' before 2 and a '-' before 1 and concatenate 
    them to build the expression "+2-1".
    Return the number of different expressions that you can build, which evaluates to target.

    

    Example 1:
    Input: nums = [1,1,1,1,1], target = 3
    Output: 5
    Explanation: There are 5 ways to assign symbols to make the sum of nums be target 3.
    -1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 3
    +1 - 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 3
    +1 + 1 - 1 + 1 + 1 = 3
    +1 + 1 + 1 - 1 + 1 = 3
    +1 + 1 + 1 + 1 - 1 = 3

    Example 2:
    Input: nums = [1], target = 1
    Output: 1
    

    Constraints:
    1 <= nums.length <= 20
    0 <= nums[i] <= 1000
    0 <= sum(nums[i]) <= 1000
    -1000 <= target <= 1000

    474. Ones and Zeroes
    https://leetcode.com/problems/ones-and-zeroes/
    You are given an array of binary strings strs and two integers m and n.

    Return the size of the largest subset of strs such that there are at most m 0's and n 1's in 
    the subset.

    A set x is a subset of a set y if all elements of x are also elements of y.

    

    Example 1:
    Input: strs = ["10","0001","111001","1","0"], m = 5, n = 3
    Output: 4
    Explanation: The largest subset with at most 5 0's and 3 1's is {"10", "0001", "1", "0"}, so the answer is 4.
    Other valid but smaller subsets include {"0001", "1"} and {"10", "1", "0"}.
    {"111001"} is an invalid subset because it contains 4 1's, greater than the maximum of 3.

    Example 2:
    Input: strs = ["10","0","1"], m = 1, n = 1
    Output: 2
    Explanation: The largest subset is {"0", "1"}, so the answer is 2.
    

    Constraints:
    1 <= strs.length <= 600
    1 <= strs[i].length <= 100
    strs[i] consists only of digits '0' and '1'.
