    509. Fibonacci Number
    https://leetcode.com/problems/fibonacci-number/
    The Fibonacci numbers, commonly denoted F(n) form a sequence, called the Fibonacci 
    sequence, such that each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1. 
    That is,

    F(0) = 0, F(1) = 1
    F(n) = F(n - 1) + F(n - 2), for n > 1.
    Given n, calculate F(n).

    

    Example 1:
    Input: n = 2
    Output: 1
    Explanation: F(2) = F(1) + F(0) = 1 + 0 = 1.

    Example 2:
    Input: n = 3
    Output: 2
    Explanation: F(3) = F(2) + F(1) = 1 + 1 = 2.

    Example 3:
    Input: n = 4
    Output: 3
    Explanation: F(4) = F(3) + F(2) = 2 + 1 = 3.
    

    Constraints:
    0 <= n <= 30

class Solution {
public:
    int fib(int n) {
        if (n<=1) return n;
        vector<int> dp(n+1, 0);
        dp[1] = 1;
        for (int i = 2; i <= n; ++i) {
            dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2];
        }
        return dp[n];

    70. Climbing Stairs
    https://leetcode.com/problems/climbing-stairs/
    You are climbing a staircase. It takes n steps to reach the top.
    Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?


    Example 1:
    Input: n = 2
    Output: 2
    Explanation: There are two ways to climb to the top.
    1. 1 step + 1 step
    2. 2 steps

    Example 2:
    Input: n = 3
    Output: 3
    Explanation: There are three ways to climb to the top.
    1. 1 step + 1 step + 1 step
    2. 1 step + 2 steps
    3. 2 steps + 1 step
    

    Constraints:
    1 <= n <= 45
