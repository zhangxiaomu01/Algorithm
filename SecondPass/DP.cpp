    509. Fibonacci Number
    https://leetcode.com/problems/fibonacci-number/
    The Fibonacci numbers, commonly denoted F(n) form a sequence, called the Fibonacci 
    sequence, such that each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1. 
    That is,

    F(0) = 0, F(1) = 1
    F(n) = F(n - 1) + F(n - 2), for n > 1.
    Given n, calculate F(n).

    

    Example 1:
    Input: n = 2
    Output: 1
    Explanation: F(2) = F(1) + F(0) = 1 + 0 = 1.

    Example 2:
    Input: n = 3
    Output: 2
    Explanation: F(3) = F(2) + F(1) = 1 + 1 = 2.

    Example 3:
    Input: n = 4
    Output: 3
    Explanation: F(4) = F(3) + F(2) = 2 + 1 = 3.
    

    Constraints:
    0 <= n <= 30

    70. Climbing Stairs
    https://leetcode.com/problems/climbing-stairs/
    You are climbing a staircase. It takes n steps to reach the top.
    Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?


    Example 1:
    Input: n = 2
    Output: 2
    Explanation: There are two ways to climb to the top.
    1. 1 step + 1 step
    2. 2 steps

    Example 2:
    Input: n = 3
    Output: 3
    Explanation: There are three ways to climb to the top.
    1. 1 step + 1 step + 1 step
    2. 1 step + 2 steps
    3. 2 steps + 1 step
    

    Constraints:
    1 <= n <= 45

    746. Min Cost Climbing Stairs
    https://leetcode.com/problems/min-cost-climbing-stairs/
    You are given an integer array cost where cost[i] is the cost of ith step on a staircase. 
    Once you pay the cost, you can either climb one or two steps.

    You can either start from the step with index 0, or the step with index 1.

    Return the minimum cost to reach the top of the floor.

 

    Example 1:
    Input: cost = [10,15,20]
    Output: 15
    Explanation: You will start at index 1.
    - Pay 15 and climb two steps to reach the top.
    The total cost is 15.

    Example 2:
    Input: cost = [1,100,1,1,1,100,1,1,100,1]
    Output: 6
    Explanation: You will start at index 0.
    - Pay 1 and climb two steps to reach index 2.
    - Pay 1 and climb two steps to reach index 4.
    - Pay 1 and climb two steps to reach index 6.
    - Pay 1 and climb one step to reach index 7.
    - Pay 1 and climb two steps to reach index 9.
    - Pay 1 and climb one step to reach the top.
    The total cost is 6.
    

    Constraints:
    2 <= cost.length <= 1000
    0 <= cost[i] <= 999
