//479. Largest Palindrome Product
//https://leetcode.com/problems/largest-palindrome-product/
/*
The key insight for this problem is to solve two problems:
1. Arrange the potential palindrome number in descending order;
2. Check whether the palindrome can be the product of two n-digit numbers
We will have two approaches: 1. First build the palindrome number and 
check whether it can be the product of the two n-digit numbers; 2. Start from
two n-digit numbers, and check whether their product can be the palindrome.
A very detailed explanation can be found:

/*
My idea is to update and record head in each turn. when the total number becomes 1, head is the only number left.

When will head be updated?

if we move from left
if we move from right and the total remaining number % 2 == 1
like 2 4 6 8 10, we move from 10, we will take out 10, 6 and 2, head is deleted and move to 4
like 2 4 6 8 10 12, we move from 12, we will take out 12, 8, 4, head is still remaining 2
then we find a rule to update our head.

example:
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24

Let us start with head = 1, left = true, step = 1 (times 2 each turn), remaining = n(24)

we first move from left, we definitely need to move head to next position. (head = head + step)
So after first loop we will have:
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 - > 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20 22 24
head = 2, left = false, step = 1 * 2 = 2, remaining = remaining / 2 = 12

second loop, we move from right, in what situation we need to move head?
only if the remaining % 2 == 1, in this case we have 12 % 2 == 0, we don't touch head.
so after this second loop we will have:
2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20 22 24 - > 2 6 10 14 18 22
head = 2, left = true, step = 2 * 2 = 4, remaining = remaining / 2 = 6

third loop, we move from left, move head to next position
after third loop we will have:
2 6 10 14 18 22 - > 6 14 22
head = 6, left = false, step = 4 * 2 = 8, remaining = remaining / 2 = 3

fourth loop, we move from right, NOTICE HERE:
we have remaining(3) % 2 == 1, so we know we need to move head to next position
after this loop, we will have
6 14 22 - > 14
head = 14, left = true, step = 8 * 2 = 16, remaining = remaining / 2 = 1

while loop end, return head

        while(remaining > 1){
            if(fromLeft || remaining % 2 == 1)
                res += step;
            remaining /= 2;
            //step should multiply by 2 since we take off one element
            //for each round, and cause the gap larger and larger!
            step *= 2;
